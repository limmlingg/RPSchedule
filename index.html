	<h1>Basic Media Training</h1>

	<p>Note: This guide is a very basic introduction to the technical side of broadcasting in Radio Pulze. If you want to learn more about broadcast, ask your producer or the Broadcast Director. If you need technical assistance, please refer to the <a href="#">Troubleshooting Guide</a> instead.</p>

	<p>In Radio Pulze, you have many things to do during your weekly broadcast session. These things include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Setting up equipment and Sound-checks</li>
		<li>Talking</li>
		<li>Playing music</li>
		<li>Recording the broadcast session</li>
		<li>Exporting the recording</li>
		<li>Troubleshooting</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Don't worry! None of these are as difficult as they seem (except for talking - it's exactly as difficult as you expected). We've designed this process to be as simple as we can, and we're always here to help you!</p>
	<p>Let's start with something slightly scary.</p>
	<h2>Setting Up Equipment</h2>
	<blockquote>You: "Hold on. I don't know anything about these new fangled technology things!"</blockquote>
	<p>Well, do you know what a microphone is? Do you know what headphones are? Have you seen a computer before?</p>
	<p>See? You know most of these technology things already! There are only two other things you probably don't know:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Mixer</li>
		<li>Headphones amp</li>
	</ul>
	<p>They both might look kind of scary, because there are sooo many buttons, but you won't be touching most of the buttons anyway, so it's fine!</p>
	<h3>Mixer</h3>
	<p>There are many buttons and knobs on this thing, but focus! If you look at the top, you can see 4 cables plugged in. These 4 cables connect the 4 microphones to the mixer. From left to right, these microphones are 1, 2, 3 and 4.</p>
	<p>Easy to remember, right?</p>
	<p>If you notice, each microphone has its own entire column, with some knobs and a slider at the bottom. So from left to right, the first column is for mic 1, the second column for mic 2 and so on.</p>
	<p>Fyi, these columns are called "channels."</p>
	<p>The slider is pretty intuitive. If you slide it upwards, the sound is louder. If you slide it downwards, the sound is quieter. Mind-blowing.</p>
	<p>Fyi, these sliders are actually called "faders." But who cares.</p>
	<p>Now, let's look at the top of the mixer. Just below the mic cable thing, you'll see a little knob called gain. Gain is pretty interesting. If you turn the knob clockwise, the volume increases. If you turn the knob anti-clockwise, the volume decreases.</p>
	<blockquote>You: "Wait, did you just say the volume changes? Why are there two things doing the same function?"</blockquote>
	<p>Now, Gain and the volume slider might seem to do the same thing, but SURPRISE! They don't.</p>
	<p>Gain basically controls the sensitivity of the mic. It might sound like it's just making your voice louder, but that's just because the mic is picking up more of your voice. If you turn the gain all the way up, you can even hear the air-conditioner in the room blowing away, so you don't want the gain to be too high. Maybe you want your listeners to hear your nails tapping on your phone screen during your show, but as your President, I say LOWER YOUR GAIN.</p>
	<p>On the other hand, the volume slider just controls how soft or loud the sound is.</p>
	<p>Right above the volume slider are two buttons: Solo and Mute. You can ignore Solo. In fact, don't even touch Solo. Don't do it.</p>
	<p>Mute is a lot more useful. Whenever you want to take a break from talking to imaginary people during the show, or you want to swear about how hard it is to not swear for 1.5 hours, just hit that Mute button and your mic will be silenced. Keep in mind that your co-broadcaster's mic might still be able to pick up your voice though! We recommend muting everybody and unmuting everybody simultaneously so that this doesn't happen.</p>
	<p>Some people find the Mute button confusing, however. Look at the button. There's a little light next to that button. Is the light on? If yes, that means that the Mute button is telling the truth: you are indeed muted. The light is off? That means the Mute button doesn't have your back; you are not muted. That means people can hear you.</p>
	<p>You don't need to know the rest of the knobs and buttons in each channel, but you are welcome to ask your producers if you're curious!</p>
	<p>Now, let's move on to the stuff on the right of the mixer. They look very different from the channels on the left, right?</p>
	<p>However, there's one thing that looks familiar: the volume sliders at the bottom right corner, labelled Alt 3/4 and Main. These ones are special sliders.</p>
	<p>As you expect, these things adjust volumes. Unlike the previous sliders, that adjust the volume for its corresponding microphone, these sliders adjust the master volume for all the microphones. Say what?!</p>
	<p>What happens is, the 4 microphones are individually controlled by the sliders and gain in that channel. Afterwards, all the sound from the 4 microphones get combined into 1 sound. This 1 sound is then duplicated so that Alt 3/4 and Main both get the same sound.</p>
	<p>Alt 3/4 is the audio that you hear in your headphones. Main is the audio that is fed into the computer and broadcasted to the world. So the sound you hear in your headphones is pretty much the sound that other people hear when they tune in. They have separate volume sliders so you can adjust your volume without affecting the broadcast volume.</p>
	<p>Oh, the other buttons and knobs on the right side? DON'T TOUCH THEM. That is all.</p>
	<p>In summary, here are the things you can do with the mixer:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Adjust gain of each microphone</li>
		<li>Adjust volume of each microphone</li>
		<li>Mute/Unmute individual microphones</li>
		<li>Adjust the volume of all microphones</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Headphones Amp</h3>
	<p>This little machine connects the mixer to your headphones so that you can hear your voice as you're talking! The audio moves from the mixer, to this amp, then to your headphones. There are 4 channels here (not to be confused with the mixer's channels), all the channels have the exact same audio.</p>
	<p>Each channel has a bunch of knobs, but you should look for the bottom-left knob that adjusts volume. If you rotate it clockwise, the volume in the headphones connected to that channel increases. Rotate it anti-clockwise, and the volume decreases.</p>
	<p>Every headphone is connected to one of the channels. Unfortunately, it's hard to tell which pair of headphones is connected to which channel, so just try each knob until your headphones' volume changes. Take care not to deafen your co-broadcasters in the process.</p>
	<h3>How to Set Up</h3>
	<p>When you first walk in to the studio, you need to turn on the equipment. There are three power buttons you need to press, <strong>in this order</strong>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>At the back of the mixer</li>
		<li>On the right corner of the headphones amp</li>
		<li>On the back of the Mac</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It's very important to turn them on in that order! If you turn the Mac on before the mixer and headphones amp, the Mac won't be able to find them, and it won't work properly.</p>
	<p>Once the Mac is turned on, log in with the user name and password we told you. (If you forgot, ask your producer!)</p>
	<p>When you're logged in, look at the taskbar at the bottom of the screen. Open the program MegaSeg, and open the file Broadcast Template by clicking on their icons in the taskbar.</p>
	<blockquote>You: "Wait, what are these two things you just asked me to open?"</blockquote>
	<p>We'll get back to MegaSeg later. Let's start with the broadcast template. This launches a program called GarageBand, which we use for recording broadcasts. This program is very important when doing sound-checks.</p>
	<h4>Sound-Checks</h4>
	<p>Basically, this is just to check that your mic is working, your setup is correct so that your broadcast later on won't just be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_air">dead air</a>. Of course, this should be carried out <strong>before</strong> broadcast, as sound-checks tend to be full of nonsensical noises.</p>
	<p>Firstly, you need to have GarageBand open (with the broadcast template, not any old GarageBand file). In GarageBand, press the button with the red circle. This will begin recording whatever input you have. Start talking into any unmuted microphone.</p>
	<p>Once you click the button, you'll see a red rectangle appear on the track and grow continuously. If you look in the rectangle, you can see a line. If the line is flat throughout, that means you are not making sounds. If the line moves upwards, that means it detected some sounds. Typically, the line will move up and down continuously.</p>
	<p>Y'know, sound waves and stuff.</p>
	<p>Once you see those lines move, you know that GarageBand is picking up sound from the microphones. Excellent. Now we just need to adjust the volume to an optimal level. Let's look back at the mixer.</p>
	<p>Above the Alt 3/4 and Main volume sliders on the right, you'll see 2 columns of little lights. When you make a sound, some of those bulbs will light up, indicating the volume you spoke at.</p>
	<p>Notice there are 3 different colours of lights: Red, orange and green. You want your typical talking volume to fall in the high green range, and talking as a group (or laughing) to fall in the orange zone.</p>
	<p>Never EVER hit the red zone! Notice the red zone is labelled "Clip". This means when your volume is too loud, the mixer doesn't want the listeners to go deaf, so it cuts out some of the audio to make the volume softer. This results in very distorted-sounding audio, which we do not want in a radio broadcast. Don't get clipped!</p>
	<p>After you are satisfied with the volume, mute the mics and stop the recording on GarageBand. (The stop button has a square icon - you sure you don't know what it looks like?) Also, delete this recording, we don't want that when we replay this clip!</p>
	<h4>MegaSeg</h4>
	<p>Going back to the Mac, remember we opened up a program called MegaSeg? This program is our music library and playlist for our radio show.</p>
	<p>There are two columns. The one on the left is the music library, all the music that we have available and can play on air. The column on the right is the playlist, what tracks we are going to play during the show.</p>
	<p>To add a song to the playlist, just drag it from the library (on the left) to the playlist (on the right). To delete a song from the playlist, just drag it from the playlist (on the righ) to the library (on the left). Basically, it's just like Tinder.</p>
